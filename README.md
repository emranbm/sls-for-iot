[![Master Pipeline](https://github.com/emranbm/sls-for-iot/workflows/Main%20Workflow/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/emranbm/sls-for-iot/actions/workflows/main.yml)

A design for IoT devices to share their storage across a local network  
It's my Master of Science project at [Sharif university of technology](http://www.sharif.ir/).

## Roadmap
Here's my roadmap to get the project done. It's not fixed and is subject to change if required.
- [x] Define the project
- [x] Get the acceptance of the proposal
- [x] Create a dockerized simulation environment
- [ ] Design and semi-implement the shared storage
  - [ ] Save file -> Current state: Test
  - [ ] Read file
  - [ ] Delete file
  - [ ] List files
- [ ] Test and Benchmark
- [ ] Revise the design and implementation, if needed
- [ ] Write down the paper
- [ ] Create presentation
- [ ] Defend the dissertation
- [ ] Enjoy the rest of your non-academic life!  
(Is it going to check ever? I hope so!)
